   CVS is a source code repository maintainance system, which allows a group of
   developers located at distant places to work at the same source code over
   the internet.  This sounds complicated at first, but using CVS is really
   easy, even if you have never used it before.  If you want to contribute to
   the Husky project (and be it only for making some bug fixes from time to
   time), we suggest you install CVS and get a login to our CVS server.</P>
   <P>In the following, you can see a very little introduction
   how CVS works and how you should and can use it, once you have gotten your
   account.  If you want to know CVS in more detail, please also read the
   documentation (info-pages) of CVS. They are very instructive.
<P>
<OL>
  <LI><I>Note:</I> This description only covers the command line version of CVS.
    However, if you are using a GUI version, the steps are the same, but there
    might be some differences and problems.
    <P></P>
  <LI>All CVS commands require a connection to the CVS server.
    <P></P>
  <LI><A href="http://www.cyclic.com/cyclic-pages/howget.html">Get CVS</A> for
    your platform and install it. Please be sure to use at least version 1.10.
    <BR>
    Do not use CVS under different platforms on the same work source tree. <BR>
    Do not use one working directory for more then one CVS connection.
    <P></P>
  <LI>Recommended settings for CVS (add to .cvsrc in your home directory):<BR>
    <CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;cvs -z3<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;checkout -P<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;update -P<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;diff -c </CODE>
    <P></P>
  <LI>Login into the CVS Server:
    <UL>
      <LI>If you want to use the CVS server with weite access, send a netmail
        to 2:2476/418 or an email to <a href="mailto:tobi@bland.fido.de">Tobias
        Ernst</a> with your real name and fido- or othernet-aka. You will receive
        an ID (normally <I><KBD>&lt;firstname&gt;.&lt;lastname&gt;</KBD></I>)
        and a password. <BR>

<!--      <LI>If you want readonly access to the CVS server, you can use the anonymous
        login: Use <KBD>anonymous</KBD> as ID and <KBD>anonymous</KBD> as password.
        <BR> -->
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <UL>
      <LI>Set the environment variable CVSROOT to <KBD>:pserver:<I>&lt;ID&gt;</I>@cvs.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de:/cvs2</KBD>
        <BR>
      <LI>Type <KBD>cvs login</KBD> to "login" the CVS Server. CVS will ask you
        for a password that will be checked and stored if it is correct.<BR>
        <I>Note:</I> Login here does not mean that you're holding a permanent
        connection to the CVS server. A new connection will be established everytime
        when required. All login-information will be stored in a local file called
        <KBD>.cvspass</KBD> in your <I>home</I> directory (and deleted after logout),
        some additional information will be stored in a directory <KBD>CVS</KBD>
        under the <I>working</I> directory.
        <P></P>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>Get your work source tree:
    <UL>
      <LI>Type <KBD>cvs co . </KBD>to checkout the latest version of the husky
        source tree of all modules on the cvs-server. A new directory for any
        module will be created in the current directory containing the sources.
      <LI>Type <KBD></KBD><KBD>cvs co <I>&lt;module&gt;</I> [...] </KBD>for one
        or more modules. To get a list of all mudules type: <KBD>cvs history .
        </KBD>
        <P></P>
        <!--
      <LI>[ If you want to checkout an earlier version, type <KBD>cvs co -r &lt;tag&gt;
        <i>module</i> </KBD> and you will get Beta-&lt;tag&gt;. ]
        <P></P> </LI> --></LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>Do your modifications:
    <UL>
      <LI>Please group them together to match one log message. Do not do thousands
        of completely different modifications that do not depend on each other.
        As CVS saves the log message you enter with every file you have modified
        it is not very clever to do a long list of changes.<BR>
        I.e. if you want to implement a new feature and fix a bug in an already
        existing module that is independent to the new feature, first fix the
        bug and commit the changes (see below) and then implement the new feature.
        <!--<br>
      <LI>[ Use gnu indent on the sources you have modified to make sure they
        match the style guide! This is important because if two developers do
        the same changes, CVS can resolve this only if they are really identical.<BR>
        Indent also really helps keeping the source readable. Please read stylguid.txt
        in the source tree for more details. ] --><BR>
      <LI>Make sure your sources are compileable!
        <P></P>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>To see what you or others have changed:
    <UL>
      <LI>If you want to review the changes you have done type <KBD>cvs diff</KBD>
        . This will create a diff file. If you are using the above settings it
        will create a context diff which is IMHO easier to read. <BR>
      <LI>You can also use <KBD>cvs diff <I>&lt;file&gt;</I> [...]</KBD> to only
        see the changes of the file(s) you have specified. <!--
      <LI>If you want to see the changes done from one revision to another use
        <KBD>cvs diff -r &lt;rev1&gt; -r &lt;rev2&gt; [&lt;file(s)&gt;]</KBD>
        where &lt;rev1&gt; and &lt;rev2&gt; can be tags (i.e. <CODE>XH3</CODE>)
        or revision numbers (i.e. <CODE>1.2</CODE>). -->
        <P></P>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>Update your work source tree:
    <UL>
      <LI>Type <KBD>cvs up</KBD> in the root directory of your work source tree
        to update it. This is only necessary when other developers committed changes.
        <BR>
      <LI>If there were conflicts, you will be notified by CVS and you have to
        resolve them by hand. CVS will save the two conflicting parts and mark
        them for you.
        <P></P>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>Commit your changes: (only non-anonymous users)
    <UL>
      <LI>Type <KBD>cvs ci [<I>&lt;file&gt;</I> [...]]</KBD> to commit your changes.
        If you use <KBD>cvs ci</KBD> in the root directory of your work source
        tree, all modified files will be committed. <BR>
      <LI>You will be asked for a log entry. Please read the notes in the template 
        and enter a detailed description. This description will also be used in 
        the changes.log.<BR>
        <I>Note:</I> if you are using a GUI version of CVS that does not use "<CODE>CVS:</CODE>"
        to mark comments in a template, you must remove all lines starting with
        "<CODE>CVS:</CODE>" by hand.
        <P></P>
      </LI>
    </UL>

      <P>If you forget to update and another developer committed changes to the
        same file, your commit will be rejected. </P>
