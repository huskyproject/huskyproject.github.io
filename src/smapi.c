      <h3>What is SMAPI?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Smapi</strong> is a modified message API for accesing *.MSG, Squish and Jam
	message base files. It is required for all other Husky software. </p>
	<p> As the source only builds a single library, there may be no binary package of smapi for your platform.
	 In that case, Husky does not support shared libraries on your platform and you will not need a smapi
	  package at all, because the binaries of the other projects will be stand-alone binaries.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>What does it need?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Operating systems:
        <ul>
          <li>All supported platforms.
        </ul>
        Caveats:
        <ul>
          <li>If you need two versions of SMAPI at once, e.g. because you want to use both <tt>hpt 0.9.7-stable</tt>, which requires <tt>smapi 1.6.4</tt>, but also want to use <tt>msged 6.0.0-release</tt>, which requires <tt>smapi 2.0</tt>, you will find instructions in the file <tt>DEPENDENCIES</tt> in the
          <tt><a href="huskybse.html">huskybse</a></tt>&nbsp v1.4 RC4 package.</li>
        </ul>
