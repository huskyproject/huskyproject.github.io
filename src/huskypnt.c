      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>HuskyPnt</strong> is a point-package based on husky-Software.
        After answering a few questions (most can just be skipped, there are
        reasonable defaults) it will compile and install the libraries (smapi,
        fidoconf) and programs and generate a working config.<br>
        It is intended to support almost any platform and (natural) language
	and will be multi-user capable, but currently it only runs under Linux
        with german or english questions (the config remarks are in german)
        and for a single user.
