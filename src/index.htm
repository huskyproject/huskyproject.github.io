    <h3>What is <em>Husky</em>?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        The goal of this project is to develop a complete freeware suite of Fidonet
        applications, running under Linux and other multitasking/multiuser systems. The suite
        should be comparable to now existing (and partly commercial) OS/2 systems.<br>
        Most of the software here is GPLed unless otherwise specified.<br>
        To keep the configuration simple and reliable, all applications should use one set
        of configuration-files.

      <h3>Fido-area and mailinglist</h3>
      <blockquote>
        The international developer and support echo for Husky is called <tt>FIDOSOFT.HUSKY</tt>.
        It is routed through the WWB and gated to a mailinglist. If you can not get the echo, ask
        <a href="mailto:mtt@tichy.de">Matthias Tichy</a> or
        <a href="mailto:tobi@physcip.uni-stuttgart.de">Tobias Ernst</a> for a binkp, ISDN
        or analog feed to this echo, or you can subscribe/unsubscribe to the mailinglist
        (which is gated with the echo) using
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/husky-discuss">lists.sourceforge.net</a>
        and write your articles to <a href="mailto:husky-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net">husky-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
        There is also a FTN fileecho called fidosoft.husky. It carries release source
        archives of the husky project software, i.E. no latest files are hatched here, only
        stable releases.

      <h3>CVS Server</h3>
      <blockquote>
        If you want write access to our cvs-server, register into sourceforge.net
        and write message to one of Husky Project Managers. If you want read-only
        access, use anonymous cvs login.

      You should understand that the latest snapshot archives are generated automatically,
      are untested, and can contain all sorts of bugs and problems. If you are a new user,
      you should not start with the snapshots. Instead, try getting a stable version from
      one of the links in the navigation bar.

    <h3>Contact information</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Check out the <a href="team.html">Husky Team</a> page for details on how to contact
      a member of the Team, or each project page if you want to contact the author of
      a particular program. Keep in mind, that the author of each project is the
      <em>main</em>, althought not the only one.<br>
      Or you can reach almost every member of the Team in the official echo (or the
      gated mailinglist).
