    <h3>What is <em>Husky</em>?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        The goal of this project is to develop a complete freeware suite of Fidonet
        applications, running under Linux and other multitasking/multiuser systems. The suite
        should be comparable to now existing (and partly commercial) OS/2 systems.<br>
        Most of the software here is GPLed unless otherwise specified.<br>
        To keep the configuration simple and reliable, all applications should use one set
        of configuration-files.

      <h3>Fido-area and mailinglist</h3>
      <blockquote>
        The international developer and support echo for Husky is called <tt>FIDOSOFT.HUSKY</tt>.
        It is routed through the WWB and gated to a mailinglist. If you can not get the echo, ask
        <a href="mailto:mtt@tichy.de">Matthias Tichy</a> or
        <a href="mailto:tobi@physcip.uni-stuttgart.de">Tobias Ernst</a> for a binkp, ISDN
        or analog feed to this echo, or you can subscribe/unsubscribe to the mailinglist
        (which is gated with the echo) using
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/husky-discuss">lists.sourceforge.net</a>
        and write your articles to <a href="mailto:husky-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net">husky-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
        There is also a FTN fileecho called fidosoft.husky. It carries release source
        archives of the husky project software;  i.E.,  none of the latest files are hatched there, only
        stable releases.

      <h3>CVS Server</h3>
      <blockquote>
        If you want write access to our cvs-server, register into sourceforge.net
        and write message to one of Husky Project Managers. If you want read-only
        access, use anonymous cvs login.
      <a href="cvs.html">Read more about our cvs-server...</a><br>

      <h3>Daily Snapshots</h3>
      <p>Daily snapshots and daily diff files are available as <em>tar.gz</em> files.</P

      <ul>
        <li>via filerequest at 2:240/5034, filenames: husky/<i>module</i>-latest.tar.gz,
          husky/<i>module-YYMMDD</i>.tar.gz. and husky/<i>module-YYMMDD</i>.diff.gz.
        <li>via mailinglist: (husky-diffs@lists.sourceforge.net). You can
          subscribe/unsubscribe using
          <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/husky-diffs">lists.sourceforge.net</a>
        <li>via http from <a href="cvs2">here</a> (Debian Linux packages: <a href="debian">here</a>
      </ul>

      Each diff is available as text:
      <ul><li>via mailinglist: (husky-cvs@lists.sourceforge.net). You can
          subscribe/unsubscribe using
          <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/husky-cvs">lists.sourceforge.net</a>
      </ul>

      You should understand that the latest snapshot archives are generated automatically,
      are untested, and can contain all sorts of bugs and problems. If you are a new user,
      you should not start with the snapshots. Instead, try getting a stable version from
      one of the links in the navigation bar.

    <h3>Contact information</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Check out the&nbsp;<a href="team.html">Husky Team</a>&nbsp;page for details on how to contact
      a member of the Team, or each project page if you want to contact the author of
      a particular program. Keep in mind that although the author or authors of each project are the
      <em>main</em> contact, they are not the only one that can be contacted about a project.<br>
      Note also that you can reach almost every member of the Team in the official echo (or the
      gated mailinglist).
