      <h3>Husky Versions and Dependencies</h3>
      <blockquote>

      <p>Husky is divided into multiple packages. No matter what you want to
      do, you will need at least the basic packages <b>huskybse</b>,
      <b>smapi</b> and <b>fidoconfig</b>. These package contain libraries used
      by the other programs, as well as installation instructions and
      documentation. Then choose any other packages at will.</p>

      <p>There are two branches of Husky development: current Husky, and stable
      Husky. Users should usually use the stable release versions.</p>

      <p>Husky packages have interdependencies;  I.E., if you have chosen a certain
      version of the basic packages, you must choose the matching version of
      the program packages.</p>

      <h3>Installing from Source Code</h3>

      <blockquote>

      <p>After you have downloaded source code packages, you should start with
      unpacking the <tt>huskybse</tt> source code. You will find a file named
      <tt>INSTALL</tt> in this package which contains further installation
      instructions. Do read this file!</p>


      </blockquote>

      <h3>Downloading Binary Packages</h3>

      <blockquote>

      <p>For non-Unix platforms, we also provide precompiled
      binaries. There is no precompiled version of <tt>huskybse</tt>, as
      huskybse only contains soruce code installation instructions, and example
      configurations. If you want to see the example configurations, you must
      get the source code version of <tt>huskybse</tt>.<p>

      <p>Depending on which platform you want to download for, there may or may
      not be a <tt>smapi</tt> package. If there is no smapi package for your
      platform, don't worry, you won't need it. But you will certainly need the
      <tt>fidoconf</tt> package, because it contains vital documentation and
      tools.</p>

      <p>For Debian GNU/Linux Users there are Packages available now.
