      <h3>Current Husky</h3>

      <blockquote>
 
      <p>
      Current Husky describes the bleeding edge source code that we are
      currently working on. This is latest <b>development</b> version.
      As Husky is Open Source, you can immediately access
      what we are currently programming. However, doing so is not required
      unless you are a developer or very experienced user:
      the current cvs version may work but also may not work. 
      If you run a development version on your bbs and something
      goes wrong with your bbs, it's your problem. Make sure you
      have a good backup before trying a development version.
      </p>

      <p>Current Husky is made available as snapshots from our CVS server on a
      daily basis. Of course the version numbers of Husky do not change every
      day. So, a single version number, like <tt><b>hpt 1.3.0</b></tt>, can
      describe a lot of different versions of the software in Husky
      current. (Second number is odd for current version.)
      </p>

      <p>In order to make sure you have matching versions of the package, you
      should fetch all packages that you need at once, i.e. use snapshots from
      the same day for all libraries and programs. Then, you should re-build
      and re-install <i>everything</i>, i.e. all libraries and programs in
      dependience order, because changes of library interfaces etc. are made
      without warning in current Husky.
      </p>

      <p>Current Husky is available as follows:

      <ul>
        <li>via http from <a href="/cvs2">here</a>.
        <li>via filerequest at 2:240/5034, filenames: husky/<i>module</i>-latest.tar.gz, 
          husky/<i>module-YYMMDD</i>.tar.gz. and husky/<i>module-YYMMDD</i>.diff.gz. 
        <li>via mailinglist: (husky-diffs@lists.sourceforge.net). You can
          subscribe/unsubscribe using
          <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/husky-diffs">lists.sourceforge.net</a> 
      </ul> 

      <p>You should understand that the latest snapshot archives are generated
      automatically, are untested, and can contain all sorts of bugs and
      problems. If you are a new user, you should not start with the
      snapshots. Instead, try getting a <a href="stable.html">stable</a> version.
      </p>
